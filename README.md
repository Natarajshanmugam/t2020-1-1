# Program-1.py
    Get the integer from user and type of operation based on type of operation we will calculate the result
    
# Program-2.py
    Get the value from user input.create a empty list as output_list and also intialize the empty varialbe as odd_number.
    Run the while loop until we get length of output_list is equal to user input a.
   
# Program-3.py
    Get the value from user input.create a empty list as output_list and also intialize the empty varialbe as odd_number.
    This program is similar to program-2.py once find given integer is odd or even.
    If the interger is even then run a loop for a-1 times,append odd_number in output_list.
    If the interger is odd then run a loop for a-1 times,append odd_number in output_list.
   
# Program-4.py
    Get the integer list as input_list.
    Intitialize the empty dictionary with 1 to 9 and initialize the total_count=0
    Run a dictionary loop and also run a input_list as nested loop.if key is divisible by input_list values then increment a total_count value as 1.
    Then update a dictionary based on key with total_count
